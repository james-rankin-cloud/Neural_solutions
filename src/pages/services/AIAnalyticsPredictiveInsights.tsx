Their existing site was outdated, hard to maintain, and lacked online booking, e-commerce, or any intelligent features. Staff were overwhelmed with phone calls, missed inquiries, and manual admin.",
    solution:
      "We redesigned the entire website from the ground up with a modern, mobile-first design. We integrated Jane App for seamless online booking across all 3 locations, built a 117-product e-commerce storefront synced with Square, and implemented AI-powered site search so visitors can find treatments instantly. We also deployed AI voicemail and AI email response systems to handle client inquiries 24/7. On top of that, we overhauled their SEO with JSON-LD structured data, Google Business Profile optimization, and location-specific pages.",

    question: "What types of data can Neural Solutions work with?",
    answer:
      "Neural Solutions can work with structured and unstructured data from sources such as spreadsheets, CRMs, databases, websites, forms, ad platforms, customer support tools, APIs, and internal business systems. The exact setup depends on your current tools, data quality, and reporting goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results from AI analytics or predictive insights?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on data readiness, use case complexity, and integration requirements. Some teams can get value quickly from a focused dashboard or reporting automation project, while predictive modeling and decision intelligence systems usually require a more structured discovery, validation, and implementation process.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need a data science team to use these systems?",
    answer:
      "No. We design analytics and decision intelligence systems so business users can understand and use the insights without needing to be data scientists. If your team does have analysts or data specialists, we can also build systems that support more advanced workflows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is our data secure?",
    answer:
      "Security depends on the systems involved, but we design with data protection in mind. This can include role based access, secure integrations, permission controls, data handling rules, and clear documentation around what information is being used and where it flows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the solution integrate with our existing tools?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can connect analytics and decision intelligence systems to tools such as CRMs, databases, spreadsheets, dashboards, websites, cloud platforms, APIs, and internal business systems where technically feasible.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are predictive models?",
    answer:
      "Model accuracy depends on the use case, data quality, historical patterns, and how clearly the target outcome is defined. We focus on transparency, validation, confidence levels, monitoring, and ongoing improvement instead of presenting predictions as guaranteed outcomes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is decision intelligence?",
    answer:
      "Decision intelligence combines data, AI, business rules, and human judgment to help teams make better decisions. Instead of only showing numbers, it helps explain what is happening, what may happen next, and what actions could be considered.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of business questions can AI analytics help answer?",
    answer:
      "AI analytics can help answer questions like which leads are most likely to convert, which services are growing, where revenue is coming from, what customers are asking for, where operations are slowing down, and which trends need attention.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Neural Solutions automate our reporting?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can help automate recurring reports, connect data from multiple sources, generate weekly summaries, build dashboards, and reduce the manual work involved in preparing business updates.",
